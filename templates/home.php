My Abroad Box is a monthly subscription package service for students while they are embarking on their study abroad trip. Essentially, My Abroad Box provides you with 8 products that are not readily available overseas that you would otherwise be able to immediately purchase on a day-to-day basis. Miss your shopping trips to Target almost every other day to pick up the “essentials”? We’ve got it! These products range from your favorite toiletries, snacks, candy, and many more items. The awesome thing about My Abroad Box is that you have the choice to totally customize it yourself each month, so you’ll know exactly what you’re receiving! Not very good at making decisions? We can help you out! We offer a box that is totally a surprise to you and will be different each month it arrives at your doorstep.

<h2>A Little History:</h2>
<p>My Abroad Box was founded by Allison Zweck, a Business Administration major at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. With the help of her Principles of Marketing professor, Kashef Majid, Allison was able to turn her idea which was initially presented through a website development project into My Abroad Box! After hearing many study abroad students’ stories about all of the things that they missed while overseas, Allison decided that creating a monthly subscription box will both provide these products that they are longing for and doing so in an extremely simplified process.</p>
