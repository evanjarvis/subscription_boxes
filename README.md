The site’s URL:
http://cs.umw.edu/~chall7/subscription_boxes/#home.php
http://cs.umw.edu/~chall7/subscription_boxes/#signup.php
http://cs.umw.edu/~chall7/subscription_boxes/#new_account.php
http://cs.umw.edu/~chall7/subscription_boxes/#contact.php
This URL will connect you to the site’s main page, and the URL will change the .php files based on which tab the user has clicked on.  

The information to access the site’s database can be found in the dbinfo.php file within the templates directory. It is as follows:
$dbhost = 'localhost';
$dbuser = 'chall7';
$dbpass = 'password';
$dbname = 'cpsc348_chall7';

To test login and signup information we used these profiles:
**PUT EXAMPLE LOGINS HERE**

Information necessary to the site is based on the University’s Economic Department and how they wish to implement the data. As for now, the only necessary information to access the site is the database login information (located in the dbinfo.php file) which is subject to change.
